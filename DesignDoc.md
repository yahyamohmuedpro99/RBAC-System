# Design Document: Workspace Management System for TeamApp

## Overview: Key Role of Workspaces

### Primary Functions
1. **Virtual Container for Users and Resources**:
   - Workspaces group users, projects, and tasks for an organization or team
   - They provide administrative visibility and access control

2. **Paywall Integration**:
   - Enables/disables specific system features based on subscription level
   - Examples: kanban boards, advanced task types

3. **Administrative Management**:
   - Workspace activation/deactivation
   - Usage and billing monitoring
   - Data isolation between workspaces

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Workspace-Centric Features
- All tasks, projects, and users must link to a workspace
- Even personal tasks require workspace association
- Ensures comprehensive resource management within workspace boundaries

### 2. Data Structure Optimization
- Strategic use of `workspaceId`:
  - Direct linking for frequently queried resources
  - Parent relationship chains where appropriate (task → project → workspace)

### 3. Feature Flag System
- Workspace-level feature toggles
- Controls access to specific system capabilities
- Enables subscription-based feature management

## Data Model

### 1. Workspaces Collection
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "workspace_123",
    "name": "Engineering Workspace",
    "admin": "user_1",
    "members": ["user_1", "user_2", "user_3"],
    "enabledFeatures": ["kanban", "advancedTasks"],
    "status": "active"
  },
  {
    "_id": "workspace_456",
    "name": "Marketing Workspace",
    "admin": "user_4",
    "members": ["user_4", "user_5"],
    "enabledFeatures": ["basicTasks"],
    "status": "inactive"
  }
]
```

### 2. Projects Collection
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "project_123",
    "name": "Team Alpha Project",
    "workspaceId": "workspace_123",
    "team": ["user_2", "user_3"],
    "status": "active"
  },
  {
    "_id": "project_124",
    "name": "Personal Project Beta",
    "workspaceId": "workspace_123",
    "team": ["user_1"]
  }
]
```

### 3. Tasks Collection
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "task_1",
    "name": "Fix Bug",
    "type": "project",
    "projectId": "project_123",
    "workspaceId": "workspace_123",
    "assignedTo": "user_2",
    "createdBy": "user_1",
    "status": "In Progress"
  },
  {
    "_id": "task_2",
    "name": "Prepare Report",
    "type": "personal",
    "workspaceId": "workspace_456",
    "assignedTo": "user_4",
    "status": "Completed"
  }
]
```

## Workspace Integration System

### 1. Paywall Management
- Features controlled via `enabledFeatures` in Workspaces collection
- Example: Kanban board access validation
```javascript
// Feature access check
const workspace = db.workspaces.findOne({ _id: workspaceId });
if (!workspace.enabledFeatures.includes("kanban")) {
  throw new Error("Kanban boards not enabled for this workspace");
}
```

### 2. Administrative Controls
- Workspace activation/deactivation via status field
- Usage monitoring capabilities
- Example queries:
```javascript
// Active projects in workspace
db.projects.find({ workspaceId: "workspace_123", status: "active" });

// Active workspaces
db.workspaces.find({ status: "active" });
```

### 3. Data Isolation
- Resources linked to workspaces ensure:
  - Customer data separation
  - Efficient workspace-scoped queries
  - Clear security boundaries

---

## Permission Workflow

### Access Validation Steps
1. **User Role Check**:
   - Validate user's workspace role
   - Determine permission scope

2. **Resource Access**:
   - Verify project team membership
   - Check task assignments
   - Validate workspace access

3. **Feature Availability**:
   - Check workspace's `enabledFeatures`
   - Enforce subscription restrictions

---

## Benefits of This Design

### 1. Centralized Management
- Single control point for:
  - User grouping
  - Feature toggles
  - Paywall enforcement

### 2. Query Efficiency
- Direct workspace-level queries
- Minimal join operations required
- Optimized data access patterns

### 3. Feature Control
- Flexible feature enabling/disabling
- Subscription-based access control
- Granular feature management

### 4. Security & Scalability
- Complete data isolation between workspaces
- Clear security boundaries
- Scalable organization structure
